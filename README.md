## Programming Experiences

### [Acceleration of Monte-Carlo Simulation using CUDA and C++](https://github.com/xbx18502/kiwi_ToF_simulation))
- **Description**: Traditional Monte-Carlo light transport simulations are time-consuming. Utilizing NVIDIA CUDA, this process can be accelerated to more than 20 times faster than before.

### [Booking System with Spring Boot & Vue.js](https://github.com/xbx18502/web_app_test)
- **Description**: A front-end and back-end separation project. The front-end uses the Vue.js framework, and the back-end uses Spring Boot to implement functionalities such as addition, deletion, modification, querying, login and registration, role permission control, etc.

### [Multicore Optimization with OpenMP and OpenMPI](https://github.com/xbx18502/hpc-test)
- **Description**: Some arithmetic operations, like matrix multiplication, are time-consuming. Using multi-threading and message passing between cores can reduce the time complexity.

### Run Proxy Service on Linux Server
- **Description**: Sometimes we need to change our IP address and avoid network traffic detection. Using the Vmess protocol, our privacy can be protected by a proxy server.

## Certificates
- **JLPT N2 120/180 points**
- **TOEFL iBT**: **102/120 points**
